# Apache Maven 'Hello World!'
This is a small project for demonstrating the Apache Maven build management tool.

## Getting Started
You will need to have the following tools installed on your system:
- Git
- Java
- Maven

The following versions were used to create, build, and test this project:
```
# git --version-- 232323
git version 2.33.0

# java -version
openjdk version "14.0.2" 2020-07-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 14.0.2+12-46)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0.2+12-46, mixed mode, sharing)

# mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.8.2 (ea98e05a04480131370aa0c110b8c54cf726c06f)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.2/libexec
Java version: 16.0.2, vendor: Homebrew, runtime: /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/16.0.2/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "11.4", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

These versions are not a requirement but are provided to provide some visibility into the build environment needed to run this project.

## Building the Project with Maven
To build the project with Maven, clone the repo and run the following command inside the repo:

```
mvn package
```

## Testing the Project with Java
The project includes a [very simple test](src/test/java/com/learningjenkins/AppTest.java) that demonstrates an assertion that will always pass.

To test the packaged code, build the code and run the following command inside the repo:

```
java -cp target/hello-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.learningjenkins.App
```

## Jenkins prerequisites
You will need to configure Maven as a global build tool.

In the Jenkins web interface, go to:

`Manage Jenkins` -> `Global Tool Configuration` -> `Maven installations` -> `Add Maven`.

Give your Maven installation a name and check the option to `Install automatically`.

## Setting up the Jenkins Job
Create a freestyle job and configure it as follows:

1. Under `Source Code Management`, select `Git` and enter the URL of this repozitory:
2. **MAKE SURE TO SET THE `Branch Specifier` to `*/main`**.
3. Add a build step using `Invoke Top-Level Maven Target`.
4. Select the Maven version you configured in the previous step.
5. For the goal, enter `package`.

## Linux
Select the `Execute shell` build step.
```
java -cp target/hello-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.learningjenkins.App
```
Save the job and start the build.
